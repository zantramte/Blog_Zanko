Website for posts and news

Hello! I made a website with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to login, register or reset their password. When they are 
logged in, they can (create, delete, update => only if they are authors!) and see other posts from other users(authors).

I also added some css for better user experience, and also logo from medium, most recognized as one of the best websites for posts.
I used a lot of gems, burt also two helpers: news and post helpers to make sure the functionality of my website is good enough.

I hope you enjoy using my website!
