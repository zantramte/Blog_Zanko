Website for blog posts and news!

Hello! I am Å½an Tramte and I made a website with Ruby on Rails for creting blog posts and news!
Users can register, reste their password and log in. When they are logged in, they can do wonders.

Users can create, delete, update and see news from theirselves and also from other users (authors). 
Posts are displayed on website, and also news. I used bootstrap 5.3.4 for Ruby websites (Blog website).
I also used a lot of Ruby gems, which helped me for making website more officient and responsive.

I hope you will enjoy using my Website, cheers!
